# Note-System
LipeibinCooper's personal note system.

## Note-taking Website
I am developing a personal website for taking notes, recording temporary ideas, making summaries, planning, and more. The website will support mobile adaptation and data visualization features, among other detailed functionalities.

Currently, the project is in the ideation stage. I will be working on both the front-end and back-end, but will likely start with the front-end development. And suggestions or feedback from experienced developers are welcome and appreciated.
